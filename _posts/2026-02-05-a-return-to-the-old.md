# Refinding what was lost

I have been trying to figure out exactly what I wanted to focus on as a set of side projects. I had a few ideas,
but I believe that I have finally come to realize what I was hoping to do, bring back the freedom of the internet.
My goals are rather straight forward, I want to build solutions to problems that I have encounter or create tools to 
help me where I have seen areas of improvement. I plan to add sufficient documentation that the tool can be picked up
by anyone in hopes that it helps to solve a problem that they have. If I can get at least someone to find use in any
of these silly side projects, I will call that a win. Here is to the first, of what is hopefully, many solutions that 
I can cobble together an make available.
